            <h2>Safety First</h2>
            <p>It's important to maintain proper safety procedures while feeding your baby.</p>
            <p>There are two main feeding hazards:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Choking</li>
                <li>Allergies</li>
            </ul>
            <div className="infoLeft">
                <h3>Choking Hazards</h3>
                <p>Be aware of the shape and firmness of the food you provide. Round and/or firm foods have a higher risk of fully obstructing your child's airway if they choke, so this is why we pay attention to cutting and softening their foods.</p>
                <p>Do not serve hard foods like raw apples or carrot sticks: these are dangerous choking hazards and should be steamed, grated or cooked to a soft texture.</p>
                <p>Lightly squish foods like peas or berries that are naturally rounded to reduce their choking potential.</p>
                <p>Whole nuts are a choking hazard and generally should not be served to children younger than 4 years old. Nut butters should be watered down or spread quite thin.</p>
                <p>The best practice is to always be with your child as they eat, that way you are ready to help if they need you.</p>

                <h3>Gagging: don't be scared!</h3>
                <p>When children are learning to eat solid foods, there will inevitably be moments of gagging. They are learning what it feels like to chew and handle food for the first time. This is a good thing!</p>
                <p>If they are making gagging or other loud noises, this means they are still able to breathe. Encourage them to chew or spit out their food. Try your best to not overreact, as they will pick up on your fear and it can make mealtime scary.</p>
                <p>Choking is generally silent, your child's face will turn blue from lack of oxygen, and this requires immediate intervention.</p>

                <h3>Allergies</h3>
                <p>The top allergenic foods are:</p> 
                <ul>
                    <li>eggs</li>
                    <li>peanuts</li>
                    <li>tree nuts</li>
                    <li>dairy</li>
                    <li>soy</li>
                    <li>fish</li>
                    <li>shellfish</li>
                    <li>wheat</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Modern research tells us that babies should be given allergenic foods <b>early and often</b> to help them avoid developing allergies later in life.</p>
                <p>Serve your baby one allergenic food at a time and wait a couple days to determine if it causes a reaction.</p>

                <h3>Spears vs Bites</h3>
                <p>When your baby first starts eating, they typically have a <b>"palmer's"</b> grasp and hold food in their entire palm. Cut food into <b>spears for palmer's grasp</b>.</p>
                <p>After a while they learn a <b>"pincer"</b> grasp, which is holding food between the thumb and forefinger. Cut food into <b>small bites for pincer grasp</b>. Around the size of a chickpea to start.</p>
                <p>As you see your child gain skills and confidence in eating, </p>
                <p>Allow your child to choose how much to eat. Every baby has their own appetite level, and in most cases we can trust them to decide when they are full.</p>
