            <h2>Safety First</h2>
            <p>It's important to maintain proper safety precautions while feeding your baby.</p>
            <p>The two main hazards to be aware of are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Choking</li>
                <li>Allergies</li>
            </ul>
            <div className="infoLeft">
                <h3>Choking</h3>
                <p>Do not serve hard foods like raw apples or carrot sticks: these are dangerous choking hazards and should be steamed, grated or cooked to a soft texture.</p>
                <p>Lightly squish foods like peas or berries that are naturally rounded to reduce their choking potential.</p>
                <p>Whole nuts are a choking hazard and should not be served to children younger than 4 years old.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="infoLeft">
                <h3>Allergies</h3>
                <p>Modern research tells us that babies should be given allergenic foods <b>early and often</b> to help them avoid developing allergies later in life.</p>
                <p>The top allergenic foods are: eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, dairy, soy, fish, shellfish, and wheat.</p>
                <p>Serve your baby one allergenic food at a time and wait a couple days to determine if it causes a reaction.</p>

            <div className="infoLeft">
                <h3>Spears vs Bites</h3>
                <p>When your baby first starts eating, they typically have a <b>"palmer's"</b> grasp and hold food in their entire palm. Cut food into <b>spears for palmer's grasp</b>.</p>
                <p>After a while they learn a <b>"pincer"</b> grasp, which is holding food between the thumb and forefinger. Cut food into <b>small bites for pincer grasp</b>. Around the size of a chickpea.</p>
                <p>Allow your child to choose how much to eat. Every baby has their own appetite level, and in most cases we can trust them to decide when they are full.</p>
