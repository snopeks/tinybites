            <h2 id="MealsPageStart">Baby Led Weaning</h2>
            <p>These meals are based on a philosophy called <i>baby led weaning</i>. Essentially it means we feed babies whole foods (aka not pureeing them).</p>
            <p>As long as the foods are prepared to an age appropriate texture and size, it is no more likely to be a choking hazard than purees!</p>
            <h2>Spears vs Bites</h2>
            <p>When your baby first starts eating, they typically have a <b>"palmer's"</b> grasp and hold food in their entire palm. Cut food into <b>spears for palmer's grasp</b>.</p>
            <p>After a while they learn a <b>"pincer"</b> grasp, which is holding food between the thumb and forefinger. Cut food into <b>small bites for pincer grasp</b>. No bigger than a chickpea</p>
            <p>Allow your child to choose how much to eat. Every baby has their own appetite level, and in most cases we can trust them to decide when they are full.</p>
            <p><i>If you have any concerns about your baby's growth or nutrition, please discuss with your health care provider!</i></p>
